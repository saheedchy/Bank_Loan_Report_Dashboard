### 1. Bank_Loan_Report_Dashboard

This is a comprehensive Bank Loan Report Dashboard developed using Power BI for visualization, with data managed and processed in SQL and potentially leveraging MS Excel for the raw data source or initial manipulation.

### 2.Core Tools

• Power BI Desktop <br>
• My SQL <br>
• MS Excel <br>

### 3. Visualization:
   
• KPI Cards: Used prominently to display top-level metrics like Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Average Interest Rate. These are essential for executives to get an immediate view of the bank's lending health.

• Line Charts: Primarily used for Time Intelligence analysis, showing Monthly Trends in loan applications, funded amounts, and default rates to identify seasonality and long-term trends.

• Bar/Column Charts: Used for comparison and categorical breakdowns, such as:

• Loan Status Overview (Good Loan vs. Bad Loan breakdown).

• Loan Amount by Purpose (Home, Business, Education, etc.).

• Breakdown by Employment Length.

• Filled Maps: Used for Geographic Analysis to visualize State-wise loan distribution and identify regional disparities in lending activity.

• Donut Charts: Used to show the distribution of the portfolio, such as the breakdown of loans across various term lengths.

• Tree Maps: Provide a hierarchical view of metrics, often used for analyzing how factors like Home Ownership impact loan applications.

• Decomposition Tree (Advanced): An interactive AI visual used to drill down into a high-level metric (like Default Rate) and break it down by multiple dimensions, such as Income Brackets and Employment Type.

### 4.Interactivity Features:

• Slicers/Filters: Allow users to instantly filter the entire report view based on key parameters, including Loan Status, Grade/Subgrade, State, Month, and Purpose.

• Drill-Down Capability: The hierarchical nature of visuals (like the Decomposition Tree and maps) allows users to click on a high-level category (e.g., a state on the map) to see the metrics for the sub-categories within it.

• Grid View/Details Dashboard: A comprehensive, single-stop page provides a consolidated, detailed view of all essential loan-related information and borrower profiles, allowing for in-depth data inspection.

• Dynamic Calculations: Measures built with DAX (e.g., MoM Change) update automatically as users apply filters, providing dynamic context for the analysis.

### Business Problem:

The fundamental business problem this Bank Loan Dashboard is designed to solve is the need for a financial institution to manage and mitigate the inherent risks and complexities associated with its lending portfolio while simultaneously optimizing growth and profitability.

### Key questions such as:
• What are the total volume and value metrics for the loan portfolio? <br>
• How is the total loan amount distributed across different time periods? <br>
• What is the current average interest rate and the average Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio across all loans? <br>
• What is the monthly trend in loan applications and disbursements? <br>
• How does current loan performance compare to previous periods?

### Goal of the Dashboard:

The central goal of the Bank Loan Report Dashboard is to empower bank management to make data-driven decisions by providing a comprehensive, interactive, and transparent view of the bank's entire loan portfolio.

### Business Impact & Insights:

Insights:
• High-Risk Profiles Identified	<br>
• Loan Portfolio Optimization	<br>
• Early Warning on Credit Quality	<br>
• Geographic/Seasonal Planning <br>

Impacts:
• Reduced Financial Risk: By monitoring credit quality metrics (e.g., net charge-offs, loan status) in real-time and by borrower segment, the bank can significantly enhance the health of its loan portfolio and reduce overall risk exposure.

• Increased Lending Profitability: The ability to analyze performance by loan grade/subgrade (creditworthiness) allows for more accurate risk-adjusted pricing and credit line optimization, ensuring loans are profitable while balancing the risk of default.

• Improved Operational Efficiency: Automating the tracking of KPIs like Total Funded Amount and Total Applications reduces the time and manual effort previously spent on compiling and cross-checking static reports, freeing up analysts for deeper financial modeling.

• Enhanced Decision-Making Quality: The dashboard supports smarter, faster decision-making by consolidating disparate financial data into a cohesive, interactive view for executives and managers.
